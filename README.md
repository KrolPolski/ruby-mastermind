# Mastermind

This is a command line version of [Mastermind](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2392/mastermind), a puzzle board game from 1971. I completed this as part of The Odin Project's [Ruby curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-mastermind).

### Game instructions

You can play it either as the person guessing the secret code, or you can set the secret code yourself and let the computer guess. 

### Running instructions
To be able to run it, you'll need to have ruby installed. It also requires the colorize gem, as defined in the gem file. If you have bundler set up, you can just run:
```
bundle install
ruby mastermind.rb
``` 
Once colorize has been installed, all you have to do is run:

```
ruby mastermind.rb
```
